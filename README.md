### Because Managing a Bedrock Server is not that easy...
#### With Cubic Control you take control over your minecraft bedrock server with must have feutures like:

-> Automatic Interval Backup (with two modes available: if there was activity / not & while server online / not)

-> Auto Update (get the most recent bedrock server software with Cubic Control and never have the issue "outdated server" again!)

-> Discord Integration (enter your discord bot token into the config of Cubic Control and get discord messages in minecraft & get the log of the bedrock server in discord!)

-> Player Management (Give / Revoke Op Rights , Port Players to Players and much more directly from the CC-GUI)
