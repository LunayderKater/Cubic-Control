### Because managing a Bedrock Server is not that easy...
#### With Cubic Control you take control of your minecraft bedrock server with must have features like:


**Automatic Interval Backup**

Make Backups depending if there was server activity a.k.a a player was online, or not and take the backup whilest the server is running or let Cubic Control shut it down first.
You can change the "Server is goining down message".

--------------------------------------------------

**Auto Update**

A new feature which will get the newest bedrock-server.zip file from mojang and replace the old files without overwriting config/whitelist or perm files.
No more "Server Outdated!" message.

--------------------------------------------------

**Discord Integration** 

With a bot-token and a bot on your server, Cubic Control can do stuff no other Server Manager does!
Get Discord Messages directly into your Minecraft Chat.
Get the Server Log into a discord channel.
Show the current server status and player online count as the discord-bot status.
And much more integration coming.

--------------------------------------------------

**Player Management** 

Cubic Control makes a list of all Players including their IDs so you can ban people even after they changed there username.
Port Players to Players and give OP Rights directly from the GUI.
